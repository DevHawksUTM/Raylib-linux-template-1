# Raylib-linux-template-1

This repository serves as a simple template for the raylib graphics library.
The primary goal of this template is to be self contained, meaning that the
number of dependencies for compilation has been minizmized.
The example program is written in c++ & includes a single file and a simple makefile that
compiles & links statically to the raylib library.
To use a template that utilizes multiple source & header files, please navigate to the 2nd Raylib-linux-template:
